<h1>How To Recommend a Taxi Stand Location</h1>
<ol>
  <li style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">Close this box.</li>
  <li style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">Find the location of your suggested taxi stand on the map, and then drag the map until the crosshair is over the spot you wish to select (NOTE: The "+" and "-" signs in the upper left can be used to zoom in and out).</li>
  <li style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">After the crosshairs are over the spot you want, click on the green box in the lower left corner to submit your choice.</li>
  <li style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">You can also agree with others by selecting locations already recommended.</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 1.25em; line-height: 1.5;">And remember, <strong>Boro Taxis can't make street hail pickups at the airports or in Manhattan below East 96th Street or West 110th Street</strong>, so donâ€™t suggest locations in those areas.</p>
