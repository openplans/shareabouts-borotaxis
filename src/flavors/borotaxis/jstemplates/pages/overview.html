<h1>The TLC wants to know: where do you want Boro Taxi stands?</h1>

<p>Boro Taxis are hitting the streets! These cabs are painted green and equipped with a meter and credit card reader (just like yellow taxis). They will exclusively serve the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Northern Manhattan. We want to know where you would like to see taxi stands so that Boro Taxis can serve passengers like you. Use this map to give us your suggestions or agree with others' suggestions. If you can, let us know what times you would use the stand. And remember: Boro Taxis can't make pickups in Manhattan below East 96th Street or West 110th Street, so donâ€™t suggest locations in those areas.</p>
